# VulkanSDL
---
VulkanSDL is a package to simplify the build processes for Vulkan applications 
built on top of SDL. It is a variation of SDL App, a package builder that we 
designed for SDL Apps on top of OpenGL (and which is the core of CUGL, our 
simple game library). This is the reason for references to SDL App throughout 
this project.

While this package does add a few minor C functions to SDL, it mainly exists to 
minimize the work need to build a new project. While this may seem like a 
non-issue (CMake exists), creating SDL applications for mobile devices is 
nontrivial. Beyond compiling the software, there are issues with configuring 
the app permissions, setting the unique identifier, and assigning the asset 
directories. This is especially tricky when many of these settings are in 
things like plists or manifests not manageable by CMake.

This configuration process is particularly a problem for teams doing 
cross-platform development on Android and iOS together. We use SDL at Cornell 
to teach a course on cross-platform mobile game development. Before SDL App, 
we regularly had students submit assignments that kept the unique identifiers 
of our sample code, and therefore conflicted with each other during testing. 
Furthermore, students would develop using their platform-specific IDE (Android 
Studio or XCode), and this often led to the Android and iOS builds going 
out-of-sync.

To solve this problem, VulkanSDL is itself a Python script. This Python script 
enables the creation of an IDE project (Android Studio, Visual Studio, XCode, 
or CMake) for your application. The configured project is ready to build and 
deploy, minimizing the amount of time needed to port to a new platform. See the 
[instructions](scripts/APP.md) for how to use this script. These instructions 
are stored as a README in the release folder.

VulkanSDL is regularly tested against Android, Linux, iOS, macOS, and Windows. 
It also provides a Flatpak project for packaging an x86 Linux build for the 
SteamDeck. While SDL itself supports a wider variety of platforms, these are 
the platforms we need for our course at Cornell, and are therefore the only 
ones we support at this time.

Note that while this version of SDL App is intended for Vulkan apps, it still 
fully supports OpenGL. That is so that students can experiment comparing to 
the two.

## Dependencies

This repository does not contain any headers or binaries for supporting Vulkan.
This is not necessary for Android or CMake, as those tools will search for the 
version of Vulkan installed on that platform. However, for Xcode and Visual 
Studio, you will need to install extra files in the `vulkan` folder. See the 
[instructions](vulkan/README.md) for what to install.

In addition to the VulkanSDK, VulkanSDL is a software release composed of the 
following packages:

- SDL2, version 2.30.5
- SDL2-Image, version 2.8.2
- SDL2-TTF, version 2.20.1

These are integrated by source. On mobile devices, these have to be built from 
source anyway, so we find it easiest to just to link these as submodules to 
this project. They can be found in the `components` folder.

## Building VulkanSDL

VulkanSDL is a source code release (with minimal dynamic libraries). Therefore, 
it is packaged, not compiled. To create a release from this repository, run the 
python program `build.py` in this folder as follows:

	python build.py [<directory>]

You will need the module [PyYAML](https://pyyaml.org) to run this command. The 
optional `<directory>` is the location to store the release. By default it is 
stored  in a folder called `release`.  The version of the package can be set 
with the optional flag, `-v, --version`.

Note that you should populate the `vulkan` folder with the necessary 
[headers and libraries](vulkan/README.md) before creating a release.

## Demos

We have included ports of the first few steps of the 
[Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/) to show off VulkanSDL. They 
come complete with their own `config.yml` files for configuration. After 
creating a release, read the [instructions](scripts/APP.md) for how to use the 
release to build the demos.
