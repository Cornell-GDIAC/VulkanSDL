Depth Buffering
--------

This code is the depth buffering tutorial from the 
[Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com). There are no changes to this 
tutorial from the original beyond what was necessary for the previous tutorial
on texture mapping.

This code is presented without comments to make it easier to diff against the 
original.  People who know me are aware of how painful it is for me to let code 
go without spec comments.
