Vertex Buffers
--------

This code is the vertex buffer tutorial from the 
[Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) up to and including the section 
on the [index buffer](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Vertex_buffers/Index_buffer). 
There is no unique SDL code beyond what was present in the Hello Triangle 
tutorial.

To build this tutorial, you will first need to compile the shaders in the
`assets/shaders` directory using the right script for your platform. Then
link this tutorial to VulkanSDL using the python script. No additional
configuration is necessary.

This code is presented without comments to make it easier to diff against the 
original.  People who know me are aware of how painful it is for me to let code 
go without spec comments.
