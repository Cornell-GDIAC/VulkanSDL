Compute Shaders
--------

This code is the compute shader tutorial from the 
[Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com). The modifications made to
this tutorial are similar to those made to the uniform buffer tutorial.
Other than SDL specific changes, no real changes have been made to this
tutorial. 

To build this tutorial, you will first need to compile the shaders in the
`assets/shaders` directory using the right script for your platform. Then
link this tutorial to VulkanSDL using the python script. No additional
configuration is necessary.

This code is presented without comments to make it easier to diff against the 
original.  People who know me are aware of how painful it is for me to let code 
go without spec comments.
