Hello Triangle
--------

This code is the Drawing a Triangle tutorial from the 
[Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) up to and including the section 
on [swap chain recreation](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Drawing_a_triangle/Swap_chain_recreation). 
Note that most of the differences in this code from the example stem from that 
recreation since window handling is different in SDL.

This code is presented without comments to make it easier to diff against the 
original.  People who know me are aware of how painful it is for me to let code 
go without spec comments.
