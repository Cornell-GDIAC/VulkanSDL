Generating Mipmaps
--------

This code is the generating mipmaps tutorial from the 
[Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com). There are no changes to this 
tutorial from the original beyond what was necessary for the previous tutorial
on loading models.

To build this tutorial, you will first need to compile the shaders in the
`assets/shaders` directory using the right script for your platform. Then
link this tutorial to VulkanSDL using the python script. No additional
configuration is necessary.

This code is presented without comments to make it easier to diff against the 
original.  People who know me are aware of how painful it is for me to let code 
go without spec comments.
