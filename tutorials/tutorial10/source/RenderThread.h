//  RenderThread.h
//  Tutorial10
//
//  This is a version of Sascha Willem's compute shader tutorial that renders
//  off of the main thread. This allows us to continue animating even in the
//  presence of blocking operations. See the tutorial README.md for an overview
//  of the design decisions in this document.
//
//  This thread has ALMOST all of the tutorial Vulkan code in it. It does not
//  have the instance or surface initialization code. That is because the
//  surface is attached to the window and it must be initialized on the main
//  thread with that window.
//
//  For comparison purposes, we have kept comments on code taken from the 
//  tutorial to minimum, only pointing out changes that we have made.
