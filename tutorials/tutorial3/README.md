Uniform Buffers
--------

This code is the uniform buffer tutorial from the 
[Vulkan Tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) up to and including the section 
on the [descriptor pool and sets](https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Uniform_buffers/Descriptor_pool_and_sets). 
There is no unique SDL code beyond what was present in the Hello Triangle 
tutorial.

This code is presented without comments to make it easier to diff against the 
original.  People who know me are aware of how painful it is for me to let code 
go without spec comments.
