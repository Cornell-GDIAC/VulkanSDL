 * This library is a shim built on top of SDL and several extensions. This

 * that we feel to be missing on mobile devices. In particular,these functions
 * have to do with improving orientation detection. They also expose device 
 * information for data analytics. 
 *
 * In addition, this library provides us with a custom build system that makes
 * it easy to quickly to create apps on top of SDL.
